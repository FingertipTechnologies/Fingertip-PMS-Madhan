FT Homepage
===========
Implements 3 requirements on top of the Homepage (web_responsive Apps Menu grid):

1. App Icon Visibility by Role
   Restricts which app icons show on the Homepage grid using ir.ui.menu
   security groups, per the access matrix (see data/menu_access_data.xml).

2. Default Landing Page after Login
   Adds a system-wide setting (Settings > General Settings) that makes the
   Homepage (Apps Menu grid) the default landing page after login for all
   users, instead of Discuss / Invoicing. Built on top of web_responsive's
   `is_redirect_home` field on res.users.

3. Quote of the Day / Announcement Widget
   Adds a "Quote / Announcement" model (text, image or video, with
   contributor name) that is rendered below the app icons on the Homepage,
   with a decorative quote style for text and a marquee scroll animation.
