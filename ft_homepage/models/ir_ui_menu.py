# Homepage app-icon access for apps ft_homepage does NOT depend on.
#
# The rest of the access matrix is declared as plain <record> elements in
# data/menu_access_data.xml, which is the right way to write it — but only for
# modules ft_homepage actually depends on. A `<record id="other_module.xyz">`
# for a module that is not a dependency is an assertion waiting to fire:
# convert.py's _test_xml_id requires the referenced module to be in state
# 'installed' at the moment the file is parsed, and raises
#
#     AssertionError: The ID "..." refers to an uninstalled module
#
# otherwise — aborting the whole upgrade. That is exactly what happened on
# staging, where ft_ai_sales_insights is not installed: upgrading ft_homepage
# died on a line that had nothing to do with the change being deployed.
#
# These apps are genuinely optional — a database may or may not have any of
# them — so the fix is not to add them to `depends` (that would force-install
# an AI module on every database to be allowed to hide a menu). Applying them
# from Python lets a missing app be skipped rather than fatal.
#
# Ordering caveat: with no dependency declared there is no guarantee that these
# modules are loaded before ft_homepage, so on a fresh database an app that
# installs later in the same run is skipped here and picked up the next time
# ft_homepage is upgraded. The alternative — a hard dependency — is worse, and
# this runs on every upgrade, so it is self-correcting.
#
# Each entry is (menu xml id, spec). A spec may carry:
#   'groups' — the complete list of group xml ids allowed to see the menu; an
#              empty list clears every restriction (visible to all users).
#   'active' — False removes the app from the Homepage for everyone, admins
#              included, which group restrictions cannot do since the admin
#              implies most groups.
