"""Data provider for the Sales dashboard.

PERIOD FIELDS
=============
The dashboard mixes three different questions, so it deliberately filters on
three different date fields rather than one — see GENERATED_FIELD /
PERIOD_FIELD / OUTCOME_FIELD below:

* "What is due to close in this period, and what is it worth?" ->
  ``date_deadline`` (Expected Closing). The Opportunities card, Pipeline Value,
  the pipeline month boards, the funnel, the Conversion denominator, and the
  Opportunities / Expected Revenue columns of the executive-wise report.
* "What did we actually close in this period?" -> ``date_closed`` (Closed
  Date). Sales Closed, Sales Closed Value, Opportunities Lost, the Closed and
  Lost month boards, and the Sales Closed / Lost columns of the executive
  report all use it.

Which field answers which question is the whole design. Dating an OUTCOME by
Expected Closing was the original defect — a deal that slipped its forecast was
reported in the month it was supposed to close rather than the month it closed.
That is why only Pipeline Value, a genuinely forward-looking figure, still reads
Expected Closing.

TIMEZONES
=========
``date_deadline`` is a Date and carries no timezone. ``create_date`` and
``date_closed`` are Datetimes stored in UTC, while the filter names days in the
user's timezone — so their bounds are converted (see ``_period_bounds``). In IST
that moves a day boundary by 5h30m, which is the difference between counting and
missing an opportunity created at 02:00. The resolved bounds are handed to the
client in the payload so a drill-down filters on the identical window.

WON / LOST SEMANTICS (from odoo/addons/crm/models/crm_lead.py)
=============================================================
* Won  = ``probability = 100``, active untouched. Detected here as a won stage
  on a live record: ``stage_id.is_won = True AND active = True``.
* Lost = ``action_set_lost`` archives the record, so ``active = False``.
* Open = live and not in a won stage.

Archived is therefore what separates lost from won; a won stage alone is not
enough, because a won lead that is later archived is no longer a live sale.

ARCHIVED RECORDS ARE PART OF THE POPULATION
===========================================
Lost opportunities are archived. The ORM silently appends ``active = True`` to
any domain that does not mention ``active`` itself (models._where_calc), so
every figure whose domain named only type + date — Opportunities Generated, the
funnel, the executive report — was quietly dropping every lost deal, while the
Opportunities Lost card (which does name ``active``) counted them. That single
asymmetry is why the cards, the drill-downs, the filtered lists and a CRM
export never agreed. Everything here now reads through ``_leads()``, which
disables active_test, and every drill-down in
static/src/js/sales_dashboard.js passes ``active_test: False`` to match.

A lost opportunity keeps whatever stage it was in when it was lost (Odoo does
not move it), so grouping archived records by stage would report them under
Discussion / Demo / Negotiation. The funnel therefore takes its bands from live
records only and shows every archived record in one dedicated "Lost" band, so a
lost deal is never displayed inside an active stage and the bands still add up
to Opportunities Generated.

#
# It was briefly dated by create_date ("how many did we open in the period"),
# which is the other defensible reading of the old label. Expected Closing was
# chosen instead so the card, Pipeline Value and the funnel all answer the same
# question; the card was renamed from "Opportunities Generated" to
# "Opportunities" to match, since it no longer counts what was generated.
#
# The funnel, the Executive-wise Opportunities and Expected Revenue columns and
# the Conversion denominator all measure this same population, so the breakdowns
# and the totals row keep reconciling with the card exactly. Point this at
# 'create_date' and all of them move together.

# Outcome-side metrics (Sales Closed, Opportunities Lost, the won/lost month
# boards and the won/lost columns of the executive report): dated by when the

# on archive, so it is the only field that dates the outcome rather than the
# origin.
#
# This must stay in step with _closedDomain() in static/src/js/sales_dashboard.js,
# which the KPI drill-downs use. Pointing this at date_deadline while the JS
# still filtered on date_closed is what made the Sales Closed / Lost cards read
# 0 next to a drill-down listing 4 records.
#
# Records won or lost before this dashboard existed (or imported straight into a
# Won stage) can carry no date_closed at all, which made these KPIs under-report
