 * Dependency-free 3D funnel. Chart.js has no funnel type, and the previous CSS

 * trapezoids, with no way to show the elliptical rim where one band meets the

 * below by half-ellipses, so the stack reads as a solid object seen slightly
 * from above, and the rims stay visible where one band steps to the next.
 *
 * Band width is proportional to that band's own value, so the outline is the
 * data: the widest band is the biggest number, and a stage holding twice the
 * revenue of another is twice as wide. The shape is therefore not always a tidy
 * narrowing cone, and should not be — a stage that holds more than the one
 * before it is exactly what a sales manager needs to see.
