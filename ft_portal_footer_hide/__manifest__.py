FT Portal Footer Hide
=====================
Every frontend page on the portal domain (portal pages, helpdesk tickets, the
PMS task pages) renders Odoo's stock website footer - the "Useful Links /
About us / Connect with us" block and the "Copyright (c) Company name" bar.
None of it was ever configured: it still carries Odoo's placeholder text,
`info@yourcompany.example.com` and `+1 555-555-5556`.

The frontend layout wraps the whole footer element in `t-if="not no_footer"`
(see `web.frontend_layout`), so this module simply sets that flag. That removes
the footer CONTENT and the copyright bar in one step - deactivating the
`website.footer_custom` view alone would leave the empty grey footer band and
the copyright line behind.

Scope: all frontend pages. If a public marketing website is ever built on this
database and needs its footer back, change the template below to inherit
`portal.frontend_layout` and guard it on the request path instead.

Uninstall this module to restore the stock footer.
