        """Bar: estimated / spent / remaining per project.

        Estimated = the sum of the custom ``estimated`` field over the project's
                    tasks — the same source as the Estimated Hrs column in
                    Project Performance and the Estimated Hours KPI card, so all
                    three agree. A whole-project figure with no per-period
                    breakdown, so it stays the same across every filter.

                    NOT ``project.allocated_hours`` ("Estimated Time" on the
                    project form), which this chart used to read.
                    ft_task_hours_tracker hides the core Allocated Time block, so
                    nobody fills that field in: only 4 of 292 active projects
                    carry a non-zero value, against 50 projects holding 23,128h
                    of task-level estimates. The Estimated bar was therefore 0
                    and invisible on virtually every project, and because
                    Remaining is derived from it, that bar was forced to
                    max(0 - spend, 0) == 0 too — leaving Spent as the only bar on
                    the chart. _ft_efficiency_aggregate had already been moved off
                    allocated_hours for exactly this reason.
        Spent     = timesheet hours logged on the project *within the selected
                    period*, so the Spent bars follow the date filter.
        Remaining = max(Estimated - ALL-time spend, 0) — the budget still left
                    on the project, so it holds still while Spent moves with
                    the filter.

        Over Budget = max(ALL-time spend - Estimated, 0) — the mirror of
                    Remaining, so a project is never missing both bars. Remaining
                    is clamped at zero rather than going negative, which meant an
                    overrunning project showed no third bar at all and looked as
                    though the figure were missing; it was simply nothing left.
                    Exactly one of the two is non-zero for any given project.

        Remaining deliberately ignores the date filter. Estimated is a
        whole-project allocation, so subtracting one period's hours from it
        yielded a figure that was neither: a project with 50h allocated and 10h
        already burned in June still reported "50 remaining" whenever June sat
        outside the selected range, contradicting the 10h Actual Hours on the
        project form. A remaining budget is not a per-period quantity.
