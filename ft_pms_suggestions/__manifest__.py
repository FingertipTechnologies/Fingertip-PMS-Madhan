    "description": """

- Employees submit a PMS improvement suggestion with an auto-generated ID,
  a title, the module/area it relates to, and a rich-text description
  (supports pasted images) plus a normal attachment button (via chatter).
- "Suggested By" is auto-filled from the logged-in user.
- Status flow: Suggestion -> Approved -> Implemented.
- Once Approved, the suggestion becomes read-only for everyone. Admins get
  an "Unlock for Editing" button to override this when genuinely needed.
- On submission, a real-time popup is pushed over the Odoo bus to the
  administrators and to the logins listed in the
  `ft_pms_suggestions.notify_logins` system parameter. No email is sent and
  no outgoing mail server is involved. Recipients who are not logged in at
  the time see the suggestion from the Suggestions menu instead.
