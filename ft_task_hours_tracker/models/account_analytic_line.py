        Lives here rather than inside a single migration because the flag can
        only ever be backfilled from CURRENT job positions, and those get
        filled in gradually: the first upgrade ran against a database where
        nobody was mapped to a Trainee position yet and so had nothing to do.

        Additive on purpose — it fills the field, never clears it. A line
        already stamped as trainee time keeps it even if that person has since
        been promoted, which is the whole point of freezing the value on entry.
