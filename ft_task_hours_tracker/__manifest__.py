    # Bumped off 18.0.0.0.0, where it had sat since the module was first added,
    # through every commit that introduced a new stored field. Odoo compares the
    # installed version against this one, so an unchanged version means a
    # database that already has the module never gains the new columns:
    # ft_project_stage_id (added in d7a9431 and referenced by the task list view)
    # has no column on any database that was not manually updated, and selecting
    # it raises UndefinedColumn. Bump this whenever a stored field is added here.
    # 18.0.0.0.2 adds the stored ft_is_trainee flag on account.analytic.line,
    # which powers the "Trainees" option in the Timesheets Group By menu.
    # 18.0.0.0.3 re-runs that flag's backfill: 18.0.0.0.2 shipped before any
    # employee had been mapped to a Trainee job position, so it had nothing to
    # flag and the grouping read zero.
    # 18.0.0.0.4 replaces that boolean with ft_trainee_id, so grouping lists
    # each trainee by name instead of Yes/No.
    # 18.0.0.0.5 claims an employee's past time for the Trainee group the
    # moment HR gives them a Trainee job position, instead of it needing a
    # manual backfill each time.
